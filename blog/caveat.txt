There are not adequate data on regular salary progressions for a particular field in the UK, as salary and promotions/salary increases are subject to many variables, including academic qualifications (e.g. BSc vs MSc vs PhD), field, company, and the performance of the individual themselves. Whilst there are data on average graduate earnings per subject, these data do not capture the many routes/fields that a graduate with a particular degree can take. After conversations with senior roles in my network, I determined that approximate 5 year frequencies for salary increases and the percentages chosen are close to reality, on average.
